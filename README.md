# Minaya Ceramic Creations
 
### About The Project
&nbsp;  
The goal of this application is to create 7 RESTful API’s. I structured my project as a mock e-commerce site for ceramic items, inspired by my sister who is a ceramic artist.
The table below defines the following: HTTP methods, the path(URL endpoint), and the description of the action.

&nbsp;  


   VERB 		 | 		  PATH 		 |  	 DESCRIPTION
------------ | ------------- | -------------------
GET | /ceramics | index of ceramic pieces |
GET | /ceramics/:id | show page for selected piece |
GET | /ceramics/new | page to add newly available ceramic piece |
POST | /ceramics | add new ceramic piece to site |
GET | /ceramics/:id/edit | page to edit a photo |
PUT | /ceramics/:id | edit/update a piece from the collection |
DELETE | /ceramics/:id | delete ceramic piece that is no longer available |
